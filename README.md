The frond end gui code is in app.py
The command line application is in beat_detector.py
The resources folder has the images and audio used in the front end
The trained model is not yet integrated into the website due to the time constraints (see model_training dir)
The model training was not completed due to the time constraints as well. Therefore the accuracy is far from perfect and would require more time and effort. The code for it can be found in the notebook (non refactored)
